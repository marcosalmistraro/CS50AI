# 0. TicTacToe

There are two main files in this project: runner.py and tictactoe.py. The latter contains all of the logic for playing the game and for letting the AI make optimal moves using a **minimax algorithm**. On the other side, runner.py contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game.

## Usage

`$ python runner.py`
