# 6. Parser

A common task in **natural language processing** is parsing, which is the process of determining the structure of a sentence. This is useful for a number of reasons: knowing the structure of a sentence can help a computer to better understand its meaning, but it can also help extract information out of a it. More specifically, it is often useful to derive noun phrases to get an understanding for what the sentence is about.

In this problem, context-free grammar formalism is used to parse English sentences and determine their structure.
